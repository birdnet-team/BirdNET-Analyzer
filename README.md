This repo contains BirdNET models and scripts for processing large amounts of audio data or single audio files.
This is the most advanced version of BirdNET for acoustic analyses and we will keep this repository up-to-date with new models and improved interfaces to enable scientists with no CS background to run the analysis.

Feel free to use BirdNET for your acoustic analyses and research.

## Funding

This project is supported by Jake Holshuh (Cornell class of ´69) and The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations.
Our work in the K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics is made possible by the generosity of K. Lisa Yang to advance innovative conservation technologies to inspire and inform the conservation of wildlife and habitats.

The development of BirdNET is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the project “BirdNET+” (FKZ 01|S22072).
The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety contributes through the “DeepBirdDetect” project (FKZ 67KI31040E).
In addition, the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt supports BirdNET through the project “RangerSound” (project 39263/01).

## Partners

BirdNET is a joint effort of partners from academia and industry.
Without these partnerships, this project would not have been possible.
Thank you!
