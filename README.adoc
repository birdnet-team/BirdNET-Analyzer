== Introduction

This repo contains BirdNET models and scripts for processing large amounts of audio data or single audio files.
This is the most advanced version of BirdNET for acoustic analyses and we will keep this repository up-to-date with new models and improved interfaces to enable scientists with no CS background to run the analysis.

*HaikuBox* +
Once connected to your WiFi, Haikubox will listen for birds 24/7.
When BirdNET finds a match between its thousands of labeled sounds and the birdsong in your yard, it identifies the bird species and shares a three-second audio clip to the Haikubox website and smartphone app.
